# Excel-Project
For my final project, I created the Cash Book Automated in Excel, a powerful and user-friendly tool designed to streamline cash flow tracking and enhance financial management. This project was built to automate the process of recording cash inflows and outflows while providing real-time balance updates and dynamic reporting features.
